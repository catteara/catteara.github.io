                <h4>I plan to use...</h4>
            <p>
                Rich Black FOGRA 39, also known as #0C0C0C, for my logo and body text.
                Gainsboro is a grey color, also known as #DBE0E6, for the background of the main portion of my page and for text on darker backgrounds. As well as for the background of my logo. 
                Space Cadet is a darker blue, also known as #223559, for my header, nav, and footer. 
                Purple Navy, also known as #5D5988, is my darker accent color. I plan to use it for the :hover in my navigation and for any web links on lighter backgrounds. 
                Celeste is a pale blue, also known as #ADFFFA, it will be used for links on darker backgrounds and for other accents as needed.
